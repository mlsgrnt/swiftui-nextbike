# SwiftUI Nextbikes

A very messy exploration of SwiftUI (I finally have time)

At the moment it displays all nextbike stations in the user's nearest region and their bike count. Region detection is done entirely on-device and the user's location is never sent to a server.

I’d like to create a detail view (maybe even with a map)! I’d like to integrate with the user pin and password and try to do some renting!
