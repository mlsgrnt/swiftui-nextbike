# SwiftUI Nextbikes

A very messy exploration of SwiftUI (I finally have time)

At the moment it displays all nextbike stations in Glasgow and their bike count.

I’d like to create a detail view (maybe even with a map)! I’d like to integrate with the user pin and password and try to do some renting!
